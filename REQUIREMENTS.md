To use the artifact via the docker image, all that's required is Docker.
We tested the artifact using version (TODO: docker version).

If you wish to install the artifact itself outside Docker (following the
"extending our work" instructions in the INSTALLATION.md file), you will also
need a Java 11 JDK.
